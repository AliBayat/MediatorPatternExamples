## Mediator in Python

> **Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because theyâ€™re no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

---

### Usage of the pattern in Python

**Usage examples**: The most popular usage of the Mediator pattern in Python code is facilitating communications between GUI components of an app. The synonym of the Mediator is the Controller part of MVC pattern.


### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Mediator** design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:


- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?


#### main.py: Conceptual example

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC


class Mediator(ABC):
    """
    The Mediator interface declares a method used by components to notify the
    mediator about various events. The Mediator may react to these events and
    pass the execution to other components.
    """

    def notify(self, sender: object, event: str) -> None:
        pass


class ConcreteMediator(Mediator):
    def __init__(self, component1: Component1, component2: Component2) -> None:
        self._component1 = component1
        self._component1.mediator = self
        self._component2 = component2
        self._component2.mediator = self

    def notify(self, sender: object, event: str) -> None:
        if event == "A":
            print("Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:")
            self._component2.do_c()
        elif event == "D":
            print("Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:")
            self._component1.do_b()
            self._component2.do_c()


class BaseComponent:
    """
    The Base Component provides the basic functionality of storing a mediator's
    instance inside component objects.
    """

    def __init__(self, mediator: Mediator = None) -> None:
        self._mediator = mediator

    @property
    def mediator(self) -> Mediator:
        return self._mediator

    @mediator.setter
    def mediator(self, mediator: Mediator) -> None:
        self._mediator = mediator


"""
Concrete Components implement various functionality. They don't depend on other
components. They also don't depend on any concrete mediator classes.
"""


class Component1(BaseComponent):
    def do_a(self) -> None:
        print("Component 1 does A.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "A")

    def do_b(self) -> None:
        print("Component 1 does B.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "B")


class Component2(BaseComponent):
    def do_c(self) -> None:
        print("Component 2 does C.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "C")

    def do_d(self) -> None:
        print("Component 2 does D.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "D")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The client code.
    c1 = Component1()
    c2 = Component2()
    mediator = ConcreteMediator(c1, c2)

    print("Client triggers operation A.")
    c1.do_a()

    print("\n", end="")

    print("Client triggers operation D.")
    c2.do_d()
```


#### Output.txt: Execution result

```
Client triggers operation A.
Component 1 does A.
Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:
Component 2 does C.


Client triggers operation D.
Component 2 does D.
Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:
Component 1 does B.
Component 2 does C.
```
