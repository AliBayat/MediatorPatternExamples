## Mediator in Java

> **Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because they’re no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

---

### Usage of the pattern in PHP

**Usage examples**: The pure implementation of the Mediator pattern isn’t as common in PHP, as it’s in other languages, especially GUI-targeted like Java or C#. A PHP application may indeed contain dozens of components, but they rarely communicate directly within a single session.

However, there are still uses for the Mediator pattern like the event dispatchers of many PHP frameworks or some implementations of MVC controllers.


### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Mediator** design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

After learning about the pattern’s structure it’ll be easier for you to grasp the following example, based on a real-world PHP use case.


#### index1.php: Conceptual example

```php
<?php

namespace DesignPatterns\Mediator\Conceptual;

/**
 * The Mediator interface declares a method used by components to notify the
 * mediator about various events. The Mediator may react to these events and
 * pass the execution to other components.
 */
interface Mediator
{
    public function notify(object $sender, string $event): void;
}

/**
 * Concrete Mediators implement cooperative behavior by coordinating several
 * components.
 */
class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator
{
    private $component1;

    private $component2;

    public function __construct(Component1 $c1, Component2 $c2)
    {
        $this->component1 = $c1;
        $this->component1->setMediator($this);
        $this->component2 = $c2;
        $this->component2->setMediator($this);
    }

    public function notify(object $sender, string $event): void
    {
        if ($event == "A") {
            echo "Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:\n";
            $this->component2->doC();
        }

        if ($event == "D") {
            echo "Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:\n";
            $this->component1->doB();
            $this->component2->doC();
        }
    }
}

/**
 * The Base Component provides the basic functionality of storing a mediator's
 * instance inside component objects.
 */
class BaseComponent
{
    protected $mediator;

    public function __construct(Mediator $mediator = null)
    {
        $this->mediator = $mediator;
    }

    public function setMediator(Mediator $mediator): void
    {
        $this->mediator = $mediator;
    }
}

/**
 * Concrete Components implement various functionality. They don't depend on
 * other components. They also don't depend on any concrete mediator classes.
 */
class Component1 extends BaseComponent
{
    public function doA(): void
    {
        echo "Component 1 does A.\n";
        $this->mediator->notify($this, "A");
    }

    public function doB(): void
    {
        echo "Component 1 does B.\n";
        $this->mediator->notify($this, "B");
    }
}

class Component2 extends BaseComponent
{
    public function doC(): void
    {
        echo "Component 2 does C.\n";
        $this->mediator->notify($this, "C");
    }

    public function doD(): void
    {
        echo "Component 2 does D.\n";
        $this->mediator->notify($this, "D");
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
$c1 = new Component1();
$c2 = new Component2();
$mediator = new ConcreteMediator($c1, $c2);

echo "Client triggers operation A.\n";
$c1->doA();

echo "\n";
echo "Client triggers operation D.\n";
$c2->doD();
```


#### OutputConceptual.txt: Execution result

```
Client triggers operation A.
Component 1 does A.
Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:
Component 2 does C.

Client triggers operation D.
Component 2 does D.
Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:
Component 1 does B.
Component 2 does C.
```

### Real World Example

In this example, the **Mediator** pattern expands the idea of the Observer pattern by providing a centralized event dispatcher. It allows any object to track & trigger events in other objects without depending on their classes.


#### index2.php: Real world example

```php
<?php

namespace DesignPatterns\Mediator\RealWorld;

/**
 * The Event Dispatcher class acts as a Mediator and contains the subscription
 * and notification logic. While a classic Mediator often depends on concrete
 * component classes, this one is only tied to their abstract interfaces.
 *
 * We are able to achieve this level of indirection thanks to the way the
 * connections between components are established. The components themselves may
 * subscribe to specific events that they are interested in via the Mediator's
 * subscription interface.
 *
 * Note, we can't use the PHP's built-in Subject/Observer interfaces here
 * because we'll be stretching them too far from what they were designed for.

class EventDispatcher
