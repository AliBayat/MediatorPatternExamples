## Mediator Design Pattern Examples

> **Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because theyâ€™re no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

Examples of this pattern are presented in following languages:

* [C++][1]
* [C#][2]
* [Go][3]
* [Java][4]
* [PHP][5]
* [Python][6]
* [Ruby][7]
* [Swift][8]
* [TypeScript][9]
