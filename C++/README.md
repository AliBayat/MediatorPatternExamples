## Mediator in C++

> **Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because theyâ€™re no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

---

### Usage of the pattern in C++

**Usage examples**: The most popular usage of the Mediator pattern in C++ code is facilitating communications between GUI components of an app. The synonym of the Mediator is the Controller part of MVC pattern.

### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Mediator** design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

#### main.cc: Conceptual example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
/**
 * The Mediator interface declares a method used by components to notify the
 * mediator about various events. The Mediator may react to these events and
 * pass the execution to other components.
 */
class BaseComponent;
class Mediator {
 public:
  virtual void Notify(BaseComponent *sender, std::string event) const = 0;
};

/**
 * The Base Component provides the basic functionality of storing a mediator's
 * instance inside component objects.
 */
class BaseComponent {
 protected:
  Mediator *mediator_;

 public:
  BaseComponent(Mediator *mediator = nullptr) : mediator_(mediator) {
  }
  void set_mediator(Mediator *mediator) {
    this->mediator_ = mediator;
  }
};

/**
 * Concrete Components implement various functionality. They don't depend on
 * other components. They also don't depend on any concrete mediator classes.
 */
class Component1 : public BaseComponent {
 public:
  void DoA() {
    std::cout << "Component 1 does A.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "A");
  }
  void DoB() {
    std::cout << "Component 1 does B.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "B");
  }
};

class Component2 : public BaseComponent {
 public:
  void DoC() {
    std::cout << "Component 2 does C.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "C");
  }
  void DoD() {
    std::cout << "Component 2 does D.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "D");
  }
};

/**
 * Concrete Mediators implement cooperative behavior by coordinating several
 * components.
 */
class ConcreteMediator : public Mediator {
 private:
  Component1 *component1_;
  Component2 *component2_;

 public:
  ConcreteMediator(Component1 *c1, Component2 *c2) : component1_(c1), component2_(c2) {
    this->component1_->set_mediator(this);
    this->component2_->set_mediator(this);
  }
  void Notify(BaseComponent *sender, std::string event) const override {
    if (event == "A") {
      std::cout << "Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:\n";
      this->component2_->DoC();
    }
    if (event == "D") {
      std::cout << "Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:\n";
      this->component1_->DoB();
      this->component2_->DoC();
    }
  }
};

/**
 * The client code.
 */

void ClientCode() {
  Component1 *c1 = new Component1;
  Component2 *c2 = new Component2;
  ConcreteMediator *mediator = new ConcreteMediator(c1, c2);
  std::cout << "Client triggers operation A.\n";
  c1->DoA();
  std::cout << "\n";
  std::cout << "Client triggers operation D.\n";
  c2->DoD();

  delete c1;
  delete c2;
  delete mediator;
}

int main() {
  ClientCode();
  return 0;
}
```

#### Output.txt: Execution result

```
Client triggers operation A.
Component 1 does A.
Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:
Component 2 does C.

Client triggers operation D.
Component 2 does D.
Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:
Component 1 does B.
Component 2 does C.
```
